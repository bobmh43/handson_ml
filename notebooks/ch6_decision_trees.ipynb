What is the approximate depth of a Decision Tree trained (without restrictions) on a training set with 1 million instances?*\n","\n","Assume we are using the CART training algorithm. Each split divides the training samples into two subsets of roughly the same size. Thus, the depth would be log_2(m) = 20.\n","\n","**2. Is a node’s Gini impurity generally lower or greater than its parent’s? Is it generally lower/greater, or always lower/greater?**\n","\n","A node's Gini impurity is usually lower than its parents but not always. It is usually lower as the split minimizes the weighted sum of the impurities of the two resulting children nodes. But it is not always lower. For example, a [19, 1]-node could be split into a [10, 0]-node and a [9,1]-node. The latter node has a higher impurity than the original node.\n","\n","\n","*3. If a Decision Tree is overfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try decreasing max_depth?*\n","\n","Yes. Reducing `max_depth` makes the model less complex, regularizing it.\n","\n","\n","*4. If a Decision Tree is underfitting the training set, is it a good idea to try scaling the input features?*\n","\n","A decision tree is not affected by the scales of the features of the training instances. Rescaling the features only alters the thresholds of the tree but does not alter the tree's performance.\n","\n","\n","*5. If it takes one hour to train a Decision Tree on a training set containing 1 million instances, roughly how much time will it take to train another Decision Tree on a training set containing 10 million instances?*\n","\n","The training algorithm has a time complexity of O(nmlogm). So 10 million instances will take n(10^7)log(10^7) / n(10^6)log(10^6) = 11.7 hours.\n","\n","\n","*6. If your training set contains 100,000 instances, will setting presort=True speed up training?*\n","\n","No, `presort` would not. The overhead of presorting the training instances outweighs the reduction in time in finding the right threshold once the number of instances exceeds a few thousand.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"X9kJPXhVQslI"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"FUwwGYdSQQm8"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","from scipy.stats import
